# Quantum_Graph_Algorithms

This is a collection of quantum graph algorithms that run on the D-Wave quantum annealer. Graph partioning and community detection have been formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)problems that run on the D-Wave.

# Algorithms

- Quantum Graph Partitioning
- Quantum Community Detection

# Authors

- Susan M. Mniszewski <smm@lanl.gov>
- Christian F. A. Negre <cnegre@lanl.gov>
- Hayato M. Ushijima-Mwesigwa

# Dependencies
